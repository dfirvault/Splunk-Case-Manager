   python splunk_manager.py
   ```
## Backup Format
Backups are created as ZIP files containing:
The complete index folder structure (including empty directories)
The index's .dat file
Optional password protection

## Configuration
The configuration file (config.txt) stores:
Splunk binary path
Username (in plaintext - see Security Note)
